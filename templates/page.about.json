I spent 6 years living a very spiritually monastic lifestyle, full of practices based in connection and relating.</p><p>I am a TEDx Speaker (‘<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sdTy9IZR87k\"><em><strong>Dare to be Sensitive</strong></em></a>”) and a co-author of the <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">book</span>, <em><strong>“Being Fine: The other ‘F’ word men use”</strong></em>.</p><p>Brought up in an environment that valued “education, success, achievement, a good career, wealth, and family,” I spent 15 years successfully striving towards them all, including a MBA and an 11 year relationship that ended in divorce, only to discover that I was only happy on the surface while disconnected underneath.<br/><br/>I committed myself to mastery of a new paradigm of relationships, which included how to be authentic, vulnerable, and in approval of the so-called negative aspects of my personality. </p><p>I love working with people on becoming self-aware, working with their shadow, creating ever-evolving relationships and lives fuelled by connection and desire.</p>",

Whatever we put our attention on expands\"</em></p><p>Through our own journey of personal growth, we have come to discover that to cultivate attention and presence, we have to:</p><ul><li>Be connected to our body</li><li>Have congruence between our mind and body</li><li>Integrate our shadow; And</li><li>Find our intrinsic value, self-worth and self-love</li></ul><p>When we are able to do that, we are able to find our own blueprint, deep joy, fulfilment, and play in our lives and start to live from that place.
