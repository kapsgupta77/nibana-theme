            "text": "<h4><strong>Our Approach<\/strong><\/h4><p>At Nibana, our holistic approach is based on connecting to our core blueprint as an individual. We do this through self-awareness and self-inquiry, understanding and mastering our relationship with the life energy and people around us, and shifting our outlook towards life as we see it as an infinite game.<\/p><p>Here are the key components of the coaching model that we use in our coaching sessions:<\/p><h4><strong>Identity Work\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4><p>Identity work is about cultivating a deep understanding of who you are and how you got to where you are today. We do this by looking at things like:<\/p><h4><strong>Boundaries<\/strong><\/h4><p>Where do you say Yes to things when you are a No, and where do you say No to things when you are actually a Yes? Boundaries play an important role in defining our personal space – physically, emotionally and energetically.<\/p><p>It is our responsibility to understand our boundaries and educate people around us on how to be with us.<\/p><h4><strong>Victim Consciousness<\/strong><\/h4><p>Do you believe life is happening TO you or FOR you? A lot of suffering exists because we remain in a victim mindset, sometimes even months and years after the fact.<\/p><p>Learning how to view the world from an Observer Consciousness can shift our perspective so that we start to see that life is happening FOR us. It is a very powerful mindset shift.<\/p><h4><strong>Inner Child Work<\/strong><\/h4><p>It is now quite a well-known and researched idea (Gabor Mate, Peter Levine et al.) that most of our core beliefs and coping mechanisms are created when we are really young.<\/p><p>Through inner child work, we can start understanding how these beliefs were formed and how they show up in our present life. Once we shift these beliefs, we start to make different choices in life and can slowly start to redesign all aspects of our life.<\/p><h4><strong>Shadow Work<\/strong><\/h4><p>\u00a0There is a saying that “there’s a lot of power locked up in the basement of our psyche”. Our shadow is the parts of ourselves that we avoid or have repressed throughout our life.<\/p><p>We do this in order to fit in this world and become functioning adults. However, anything that’s suppressed ultimately leaks out anyway.<\/p><p>Understanding and Integrating our shadow can unlock a huge amount of power and helps us become a more integrated human being.<\/p><h4><strong>Archetypes\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4><p>We generally live our lives wearing different masks. These masks can be – a partner, an employee, a business person, a child, a parent etc.<\/p><p>We continuously swap these masks unconsciously as we walk through life. While we are unconscious of these masks, they control us.<\/p><p>Bringing more consciousness to the archetypes in our lives helps us be more in control and brings choice.<\/p><h4><strong>Core Beliefs<\/strong><\/h4><p>At Nibana, our experience suggests that our life is almost like a holographic projection of the core beliefs we have and how these beliefs interact with each other about the following:<\/p><ul><li>How do we define our self-worth, i.e., are we inherently good enough and worthy or not? A lack of inherent self-worth often results in continuously striving and competing with others in order to prove our self-worth.<\/li><li>How we define our value, i.e., our inherent value vs value defined by others.<\/li><li>Are we enough, i.e., do we feel that we are whole human beings or if we are somehow incomplete without others<\/li><li>Do we belong, i.e., are we comfortable in our own skin and surroundings, or do we feel abandoned by the world?<\/li><li>Are we lovable and are loved, i.e., do we feel that we have to be or act in a certain way to be lovable or not<\/li><\/ul><h4><strong>Inner Skills<\/strong><\/h4><p>During our lifetime, we generally learn skills that help us navigate the external world and be successful. However, we pay little attention, or importance, to our internal landscape.<\/p><p>Our transformational coaching uses various concepts and modalities to develop this internal landscape.<\/p><p>For example – cultivating attention, mindfulness, energy accounting, feminine-masculine dynamics, eros, principles of deep connection, embodiment, understanding desire cycle, orgasmic meditation (OM), reactivity vs responsiveness, and more…<\/p><h4><strong>Practices<\/strong><\/h4><p>Have you ever been to a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nibana.life\/corporate-workshop\" target=\"_blank\">workshop<\/a>\u00a0or a retreat where you got your head completely clear and were able to see what is possible and your potential? We call that a peak experience. Peak experiences are great for visualising what is possible.<\/p><p>However, you then have to build the discipline to become that person who can reach that potential or execute the vision.<\/p><p>We also believe that our subconscious mind is a habituated mind. If we want to change beliefs and reprogram our minds, we need to cultivate new habits.<\/p><p>At Nibana, we believe that in order to transform your life, sustainable change has to be rooted firmly in the discipline of practices or rituals.<\/p><p>This is also crucial for you to become independent in your self-inquiry process and not depend on us on the path once we finish working together. We work with you to cultivate and master practices during our time together.<\/p><h4><strong>Play<\/strong><\/h4><p>In the book, Finite and Infinite Games, James P Carse talks about the idea that a finite game is played to win or lose while an Infinite Game is played for the sake of playing and to continue playing.<\/p><p>Our coaching model introduces a set of principles for a life based on living life as an Infinite Game, i.e., creating a life where play and mystery are the core.<\/p><p>Rather than looking at life as something where we need to win or lose everything or get somewhere, what would it be like if we were to play the game of life just to play?<\/p><h4><strong>Unlock Your True Potential<\/strong><\/h4><p>We believe our true potential is unlocked when we master uncertainty and being in the unknown. A popular saying is that ‘growth happens beyond your comfort zone. Well, beyond your comfort zone lies the unknown.<\/p><p>Steven Kotler, the founder of the Flow Research Project, says that ‘in order to get into the flow, we need to be able to shut our rational mind, which is also the fear-based mind.<\/p><p>In order to be able to shut down this part of our brain, we need to be doing something that is at the edge of or beyond our comfort zone.<\/p><p>There is another saying that ‘we need to feel safe in order to fully let go. Now, we tend to create a sense of safety by controlling things around us, which is the opposite of being in flow.<\/p><p>In order to create a sense of safety to let go and experience flow, we need to build an internal sense of safety that allows us to go into uncharted territory and have the confidence that we will come out safely and with flying colours.<\/p><p>And in order to create this sense of safety, we need to build a solid foundation that includes understanding our core beliefs, our boundaries, how we operate with the victim consciousness and how to come out of it, and our relationship with desire – essentially, becoming conscious of all things that our subconscious mind used to live our life on autopilot.<\/p><p>Working with a life coach at Nibana using our transformational coaching framework, you can learn how to unlock your true potential successfully.<\/p><h4><strong>Transformational Life Coaching: Stop Overwhelm And Self-Doubt; Find Focus And Self-Belief<\/strong><\/h4><p>An experienced transformational coach is a guide who can walk you through the process of aligning your life to your unique blueprint and help you design all parts of your life – personal, professional, intimate, and spiritual.<\/p><p>This kind of transformational process can be scary to some people as sometimes it can feel like jumping off a cliff.<\/p><p>The support and guidance of an experienced life coach who has gone through a similar process can make all the difference in walking this path step by step.<\/p><h4><strong>What Coaching Services Do We Offer in London?<\/strong><\/h4><p>At Nibana, we offer online 1-on-1 and group coaching to clients all over the world. We have been working with clients from the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Indian subcontinent, North and South America and, of course, all over the UK.<\/p><p>We have found that online sessions are as transformative as coaching in person. If you are local to London, there is an option to coach in person or have a mixture of online and in-person sessions.
