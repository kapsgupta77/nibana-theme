At first, you might just worry sometimes, but it can turn into constant feeling nervous, mad, or like you can’t handle things, which is why they call it the “silent killer.”If you’re stressed for a long time, it messes you up. It messes with your sleep, makes you feel sad or worried all the time, makes you sick more easily, and can even hurt your heart. Stress starts a cycle that’s hard to break, making you feel more and more tense and taking away your peace, ability to get things done, and feeling okay.What seemed like something you could handle becomes a big problem, taking over your life and making everything hard. Furthermore, stress can have a big impact on careers, relationships, and personal growth. It might cause you to feel hopeless, impair your connections with friends and family, and make decision-making more difficult for you. Stress that isn’t controlled might get in the way of your ambitions and a happy existence. Since stress has the power to take over, you must recognise its warning signs and take preventative action to control it.<\/p>","image_position":"left","button_label":"Book Now","button_link":"#"}},"image_text_BT9irB":{"type":"image-text","name":"Image With Text + CTA","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/nibana-web_3.webp","heading":"When to Consider Stress Management Coaching","text":"<p>Our fast-paced lifestyles have made stress an unwanted companion, but when it starts to take control, it’s time to do something about it.
